This means this rate is associated with a specific program\r\napproved by the Arizona Corporation Commission, and is available only to those customers\r\neligible to participate in the program. The R-Tech pilot program will test the ability and desire\r\nof participating residential customers to reduce On-Peak energy and demand usage through\r\nmultiple behind-the-meter technologies.\r\nQualifying technologies for the R-Tech pilot program are as follows:\r\n1. Primary technologies:\r\na. A rooftop solar photovoltaic system. The size of the system cannot be\r\nsmaller than 2 kW-dc. For systems over 10 kW-dc, the facility&#x;fffds\r\nnameplate capacity cannot be larger than 150% of the customer&#x;fffds\r\nmaximum one-hour peak demand measured in AC over the prior twelve\r\n(12) months. (For example, if the customer&#x;fffds peak is 8 kW-ac, the\r\nmaximum system size that could be installed would be 12 kW-dc).\r\nb. A chemical storage system. The size of the system cannot be smaller than\r\n4 kWh. There is no maximum limitation for this technology.\r\nc. An electric vehicle. There are no limitations for this technology.\r\n2. Secondary technologies:\r\na. A device with a variable speed motor (such as a variable speed pool\r\npump or a variable speed Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning\r\n(HVAC) system).\r\nb. A grid-interactive water heating system.\r\nc. A smart thermostat.\r\nd. An automated load controller.\r\nThis rate schedule is initially limited to a maximum of 10,000 residential customers as outlined.",
